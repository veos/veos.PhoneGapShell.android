        The Video Eyes on the Street (SurveillanceWatch) app is part of a research project from the University of Toronto.
        \nOur aim is to help Canadians learn more about video surveillance and their rights in relation to it. 
 
		You can use the SurveillanceWatch app to: 
		\n* Spot the surveillance cameras in your vicinity (on a map or in a list)
		\n* Report on surveillance cameras and the signs that describe them
		\n* Learn about surveillance installations (collections of cameras with a common owner) that are not compliant with Canadian privacy regulations</string>
