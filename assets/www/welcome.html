    <p>The <strong>SurveillanceWatch</strong> app is part of a research project from the University of Toronto.</p>

    <p>Our aim is to help Canadians learn more about video surveillance and their rights in relation to it.</p>

    <p>You can use the SurveillanceWatch app to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Spot the surveillance cameras in your vicinity (on a map or in a list)</li>
        <li>Report on surveillance cameras and the signs that describe them</li>
        <li>Learn about surveillance installations (collections of cameras with a common owner) that are not compliant with Canadian privacy regulations</li>
    </ul>
